# Homework-1

In this project I take older code and update the HTML semantics for better SEO function. I provided accesibility by adding alt captions to each image and debugged broken links.

I am still learning how to float correctly and struggled to maintain the original CSS. In particular I had a hard time getting my aside to sit to the right of my main content.
